Welcome to the TPS documentation!
=================================

TPS (Tree, Plot, Stand) is a simple set of Python3 scripts for processing the TP001 dataset into the required Biomass ( Mg and Mg/Ha ), Jenkins Biomass ( Mg/Ha ), NPP ( Mg/Ha/yr ), Volume ( m\ :sup:`3` ) , and Basal Area ( m\ :sup:`2` ) outputs for live trees, dead trees, and ingrowth by individual tree, stand, species, and year. 

TPS can be run in "tree", "stand", or "qc" modes from the command line interface in :tps_cli:.
