Welcome to the TPS documentation!
=================================

TPS (Tree, Plot, Stand) is a simple set of Python3 scripts for processing the "PSP Study" forest inventory data (contained in entity TP001) into the required Biomass ( Mg and Mg/Ha ), Jenkins Biomass ( Mg and Mg/Ha ), delta Biomass (Mg/Ha),  NPP ( Mg/Ha/yr ), Volume ( m\ :sup:`3` ), and Basal Area ( m\ :sup:`2` ) tree and stand level summaries, with the capacity to produce both species specific and aggregate metrics for each remeasurement (or remeasurement interval, in the case of deltas and NPP).

TPS contains 3 core modules: tps_Tree (for individual trees), tps_Stand (for stands), and tps_NPP (for differences between stands over time). tps_CLI is a command line interface for using the appropriate module. Within each tps program, reliance on a core data structure which nests as STAND ID : {YEARS : {SPECIES : {PLOTS : {[raw data]}}}} helps to organize the inputs in such a way that they can be easily iterated across to summarize new outputs. This documentation has been autogenerated from these modules, as well as from two modules for parameterizing the computations, biomass_basis and poptree_basis. Biomass_basis contains the rules for parsing the look ups for the equations and creating functions for the equations to which each DBH can be passed in order to get the needed outputs; poptree_basis contains the database connectors and a parameter object, XFACTOR, which contains the information about the stands, plots, and study protocols (detial plot or not, mortality survey or not) that is needed to do the processing. Once these objects have been created once at the beginning of each module, they do not need to be recreated during that run.
